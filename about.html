      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to my humble abode!</h1>
        <cite>Stay awhile and listen...</cite>
        <p>Here are few words about me.</p>
        <p>
          From the early age I remember that I liked building stuff I also took apart everything else :)
          Electronic and mechanical devices alike. Even special gift from my cousin like game-boy,
          and lastly my first PC, thankfully I didn't broke it.
          It was x386 with whooping 80MB hard drive.
        </p>
        <h2>Gamer & Team player</h2>
        <p>
          I love hack n' slash dungeon crawlers. I'm a big fan of Diablo and Torchligth series. As well as Path of
          Exile.
          For many years I was avid MMORPG gamer where I could cooperate with my team to achieve common goals.
          That allowed me to get better as team player in real life. I find fulfillment in aiding others.
        </p>

        <span>For that reason I was always choosing support roles in games.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Paladin in Diablo II</li>
          <li>Combat Medic in Star Wars Galaxies</li>
          <li>Holy Paladin (Healer) in World of Warcraft</li>
          <li>Paladin in Guild Wars II</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Let's connect</h2>
        <p>
          I'm open to new ideas and I love talking with people.
          If you find my skills useful I'd be happy to support you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not hesitate to contact with me if you find any error or just want to say hi. :)
