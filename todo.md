In my experience, Piotrek / Peter is a very skilled developer who has contributed significantly to maintaining and adding new features and functionality to a webapp / chrome extension I originally created called Looty. For the last few years, Piotrek has kept Looty working for several thousand users by adapting its code as the requirements and API from Grinding Gear Games evolve and change. Despite the fact that the Looty code I wrote is quite old and hard to understand, Piotrek has been able to quickly and independently comprehend, then adapt and fix it as needed. Piotrek also communicates with the users of Looty and deftly and cheerfully assists them with any issues they encounter. I believe he would quickly prove himself to be a very competent, capable, fast-learning, and friendly developer to work with.
