### Personal Website

Added [link here](https://piotrek-personal-website.netlify.app/) hurray!

I wish to document my current and previous endeavors. I write about programming, design, drawing and other interesting stuff.

I'll incrementally add new features, for now its html/css but I look forward to include framework components and more. Probably with Vue.js. Stay tuned :)  

Tools used:
HTML/CSS/Visual Studio Code
