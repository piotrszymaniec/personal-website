### Personal Website

Link: coming soon.

My personal website about programming and my other hobbies like UI design, drawing and yoga.
  
I wish to document my current and previous endeavors.

I'll incrementally add new features, for now its html/css but I look forward to include framework components and more. Probably with Vue.js. Stay tuned :)  

Tools used:
HTML/CSS/Visual Studio Code
